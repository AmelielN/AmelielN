## Hello ! I am AmÃ©lie
Iâ€™ve always been drawn to patterns : how small details fit together to reveal something larger. For me, data analysis feels a lot like solving a puzzle: collecting pieces, testing and investigating links, and gradually seeing the picture form. I enjoy exploring data, finding meaning and translating it into something clear and useful. 
Outside of work, Iâ€™m very interested in science, astronomy, and music ; the same curiosity that drives how I look at data.
